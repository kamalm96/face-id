# Simple Face ID-like System

## Disclaimer
**Only the `README.md` in this project was partially generated by AI. The code itself is fully human-written.**

This project implements a simplified face detection and recognition system, conceptually similar to Apple's Face ID (without the security features or specialized hardware). It uses pre-trained deep learning models for accuracy and ease of use.

## How It Works

The system operates in two main phases:

### 1. Enrollment (`enroll_faces.py`)
- **Input**: A `known_faces/` directory containing subdirectories for each known person, with several images per person. Basically create a directory under known_faces, give it your name, or whoever's face you're trying to ID, then insert between 5-10 images of that person, then run ```python enroll_faces.py``` to create the embedding of the face.
- Another method if you do not have a webcam would be to run ```python recognize_face.py --image_path /path/to/your_test_photo.jpg```.
- **Face Detection**: Uses [MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878) to detect and crop faces.
- **Face Embedding**: Generates embeddings using a [FaceNet-like (InceptionResnetV1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) model pre-trained on the VGGFace2 dataset.
- **Averaging & Storage**: Embeddings are averaged per person and saved in `known_embeddings.pt`.

### 2. Recognition (`recognize_face.py`)
- **Load Embeddings**: Loads `known_embeddings.pt`.
- **Input**: New image from file or webcam.
- **Face Detection**: MTCNN detects faces.
- **Face Embedding**: Generates an embedding for each detected face.
- **Comparison**: Uses [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to compare against known embeddings.
- **Identification**: If similarity exceeds `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.70), the face is identified; otherwise, labeled "Unknown".
- **Output**: Shows image/video with bounding boxes, names, and similarity scores.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### 2. Create Project Directory
```bash
mkdir face_id_project
cd face_id_project
- After the Enrollment step mentioned above, run ```python recognize_face.py``` with a webcam connected to your computer, and it would use the name of the subdirectory created as the person's name if they exist in the webcam range, else it will display Unknown.
